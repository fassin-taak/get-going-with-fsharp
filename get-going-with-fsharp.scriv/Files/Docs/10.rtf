\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs28\b0\i0 Now that you've written and run "Hello, World!" in F# you should take a tour of F#. Start at the following URL http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tour. Once you feel ready to continue reading this book come back here.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs28\b0\i0 By now you should have a fairly good grasp of functional programming and F# in particular. You could stop reading this book now and continue your exploration of F# as needed for the particular set of projects that you are working on.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs28\b0\i0 So what value does this book on F# have/ Well, read on and you can decide for yourself whether the book fulfills any purpose and hence has any value. The remainder of this book contains mini-projects on various interesting topics from UIs to Neural Networks to 3D Computer Graphics. Each of the projects was chosen to illustrate how to solve a particular type of problem with F#. In the next chapter we will tackle the problem of writing UIs with F#. By the end of the chapter we wil have a fairly functional fractal image generator for Julia and Mandlebrot sets. So without further delay let's get started!}}
