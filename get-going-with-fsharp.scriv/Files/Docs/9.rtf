\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs28\b0\i0 I know what you're thinking!: There is something wrong here! Where is the function. There is a }{\f0\fs28\b0\i0 printfn}{\f1\fs28\b0\i0  function being called here which is taking a single string parameter as input and then outputting that string parameter to the console. But where is our function? Isn't F# supposed to be a functional-first programming language where nearly everything is a function? That is true. But in this case to make things easier like scripting, the F# compiler is creating a "main" function for us which is then called by the .NET runtime. To make this more explicit we can wrap the "Hello, World" code inside of a function ourselves. So let's do that.}
