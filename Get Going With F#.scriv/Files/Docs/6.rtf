\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs28\b0\i0 In this chapter your wrote your first F# program!: A simple "Hello, World!" program. To do this you setup your system to write F# programs. You downloaded and installed the .NET SDK (if you didn't already have it installed) and then created a new console project. You then modified the code to print "Hello, World!" to the console.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs28\b0\i0 You then took a tour of F# from around the web and returned to the book to complete some simple exercises. You also read some documentation on the }{\f0\fs28\b0\i0 dotnet}{\f1\fs28\b0\i0  command and played around with the command a little. You could say you are a beginner F# programmer, maybe even an intermediate F# programmer who is fairly competent at thinking about problems in a functional way. You are ready now to tackle what every programmer dreads and loves at the same time: UIs!}
